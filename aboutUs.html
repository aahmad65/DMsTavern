    <p class="authorText">Hi, my name is Aidan Ahmad. This is my personal project for my CPSC-3700 class at Seattle University. 
      I am a Computer Science Major and I come from Grapevine, Texas. I am a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons and I have been both a player and a DM.
      I had only been a Dungeon Master for my friends, so I never expected compensation because it was fun. While being a DM should always be fun, being able to put 
      that amount of time into creating a world and being paid for it is definitely a dream of mine. I hadn't found any reasonable ways to be paid as a DM,
      especially with meeting new people. Twitter and Reddit are always possibilites but you never knew what you were getting into, or if you were going 
      to get scammed out of your payment because they weren't satisfied with the session. This website is to fix that problem!
    </p>
    <p>This website is designed to allow Dungeon Masters to be paid for their hard work. It also allows DM's to find players throughout the "tavern". The end goal is to allow secure
      financial transactions allowing DM's and players to trust this website and use it whenever they need. A messaging system would allow them to communicate
      on their terms for the contract and allow me, and maybe a team in the future, to be able to check the conversations that were had in case our contracts
      don't go as planned.</p>
