<h1>DM's Tavern</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a personal project completed in the Spring of 2024 for the Art of Web Design class at Seattle University. It was not fully completed and made functional but it was completed in the sense of the class. The design was for my passion of Dungeons and Dragons and being paid as a DM, which is one of the things I love to do.
