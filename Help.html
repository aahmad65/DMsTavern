        What is Dungeons and Dragons (D&D/DND)?
      </span>
      <p>
        In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on 
        epic quests and level up in experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is the game's referee and storyteller.
        There's no winning or losing in D&D—at least, not in the conventional way. At its heart, D&D is a game that focuses on storytelling. 
        The dice just help you along. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to how you act, to what happens next. 
        The collective creativity in your D&D game builds stories that you'll tell again and again—ranging from the stuff of legend 
        to absurd incidents that'll make you laugh years later.
        Have fun and remember—never split the party!

      Frequently Asked Questions
    </p>
    <p class="Q">How are payments kept secure?</p>
    <p class="A">Payments are kept secure by making contracts. There is an option to simply go through PayPal if you would
        like to skip the contract. However, we encourage the use of our contracts to ensure your financial safety as well as 
      avoid scams. We can also help you retrieve your money more easily if you use our contacts. <strong>We suggest
        you keep track of the conversations between you and your buyer or seller. This will allow us to figure out who is in the right.
      </strong></p>
    <p class="Q" id="contractHelp">What are contracts?</p>
    <p class="A">Contracts are the way that we here at the Dungeon Master's Tavern keep your payments between DMs and Players secure.
      It is as simple as going to the <a href="Payments.html">payments</a> page and clicking "Create Contract". This will allow you to
      add a friend to a contract and you two can decide on the financial transactions that will happen between you two. This will allow us
      to make sure both sides keep this contract and help you out if one side doesn't hold up.
    </p>
    <p class="Q">What should I do if I no longer want to be apart of a contract?</p>
    <p class="A">If you no longer want to be part of a contract, you can send us a message through <a href="#contactFormBtn">contact form</a> (below!). We will look at the contract
      and talk to both sides to make sure no one is half committing. Once one side has fulfilled their side of the contract, the other must follow through,
      assuming it was to their satisfaction. This is why we say how important it is to <strong>keep track of your conversations!</strong>
